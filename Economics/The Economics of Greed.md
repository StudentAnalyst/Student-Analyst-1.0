# The Economics of Greed
## The Unfair Allocation of Resources

Economics, quite literally, concerns itself with scarcity (which affects everyone by the way) and the equitable allocation and distribution of resources within a society, and not only that it also deals with how individuals utilize and maximize choices based on the access of resources that they have.

The fact that economics deals with societal, scarce resources is what makes it a seemingly governmental responsibility, but the other facet of economics also concerns regular human beings, making regular choices, which therefore makes economics a multifaceted disciplinary that affects all human beings on all levels, which is why it is so exciting and fun to read about, and theorize about, because it’s a social science that we are all a part of whether we are conscious of it or not.

Even though economics is primarily concerned with choices and scarcity at its simplest level, it delves further and deeper into other issues such as economic growth, unemployment, inflation, trade between individuals and countries, prices, poverty, wealth, money, interest rates, exchange rates, and business cycles — now all these topics are exciting and affect us all, I cannot wait to speculate about it all.

Now, picture this:

*You’re a member of state or government, and you are given a particular amount of money that is allocated towards the allocation of resources, services and products for your citizens, and instead, you choose to take a high percentage of that and you decide to line your pockets instead and live a life of luxury and opulence and completely forget that you’re a civil servant who exists to ease the allocation of resources.*

*Your driveway looks like a parking lot…Your neck is glistening with rocks… Your outfit could pay off someone’s education. But, unfortunately, your ‘wealth’ is at the expense of an entire society, who trusted you with a fair distribution of resources, therefore, it is deplorable and nothing to envy. And in foresight, using national resources for personal material gain, is not only bad for the economy in the long run, but picture this, one day, you too will be a part of the society that you are responsible for. So, when you climb off your high horse, and valet park it — mass poverty awaits*

Anyways you don’t have to picture it, because it has been happening and for some strange reason (personal greed) it is still happening, despite the fact that we have been heaved towards great chaos and some people still didn’t stop to think, “Maybe I need to have a little more humanity during these trying times?” Do better.

Anyways, Adam Smith, the father of economics once said,

> No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable
>
> Adam Smith

Therefore, we can not expect a society to prosper when so much personal greed exists, we need to do better, especially our leaders.
