## Making Choices To Maximize Happiness With Scarce Resources


First of all, should we just burn all the current systems and theories to the ground? Or will we continue with the alleged ‘free market’ system of capitalism, despite what we’ve been through, because inherently, humans are greedy?

Anyways, Economics, is all about.. wait actually, is it even still about what it thinks its about even though covid-19 came through and decimated everything? Thankfully, humans will always be humans, whether we are going through climate change or pandemics, therefore, our behavior will remain humanly predictable, which makes economics, somewhat continuously relevant and thus interesting… ok, lets get into it: Econ 101.

**What on this good old earth is economics about at this point?**
Economics is about choices & human behavior…and algebra…and graphs…and diagrams — to explain and predict human behavior and choices. You thought Math was done with you hehehe, mathematics is forever! 
Anyways, and since human beings are convinced that we are the center of the universe, economic issues are present in all spheres & sectors of life.

Like I mentioned in the introductory post, Economics is a broad disciplinary, and at its simplest level, it is about the allocation of limited resources. Therefore, with the anticipation of more to come, it is ideal, if we begin right here, at the beginning, where it all started, the one thing economists are trying to avoid, the one thing that will affect all human beings: scarcity.

It is often emphasized that scarcity should, in no way be confused with poverty, because scarcity effects the rich and the poor alike. Therefore, economics concerns itself with how people maximize their choices, while conserving scarce resources. For example, if you had a residual R1200 to spend per year, how would you spend it to ensure that you don’t waste it, but also that you’re happy throughout the year? You’d probably find a way to spend R100 per month, simple, right? You have made a good choice, and maximized the benefits of a scarce resource. Congratulations!

I wish economics was that simple, but I am sure you get the point. Now think of humanity as a whole and how governments have to maximize all sorts of scarce resources, and allocate them fairly amongst entire populations. This is where the sub-divisions in economics come through as we introduce more variables, to make life easier: **Microeconomics & Macroeconomics.**

*Microeconomics* focuses on the individual aspects that make up a whole economy, including households, firms, investors, the government etc.

Since microeconomics is so individualistic in nature, it concerns itself with the economics of supply and demand — one of the simplest models of economic theory. The consequences of monopolies in an effort to create and maintain competition. As well as other issues that are centered around individual behavior — whether that individual is a household, or a firm , or a government entity.

*Macroeconomics* focuses on the economy as a whole, like unemployment & inflation. You know, issues that occur en masse.

Macroeconomics primarily look at the Gross Domestic Product, remember when the GDP dropped by like 50%, yes, that was a macroeconomic issue that represented the state of the nation as a whole — which also revealed that the current government policies are simply not sustainable, and need to be urgently revised, before, we just…head straight into an inflation, or worse , recession.

But, at least, the South African Reserve Bank, maintains a shortage of liquidity, (in case you’re trying to figure out why you never have any money), which is a sharp contrast to other Central Banks, for example, the Federal Reserve of The United State, is notorious for printing money all the time.

For example, The United States, a nation of more than 300 million people, is debating on whether to give their citizens a stimulus package of $1400 or $2000 (last I checked). Meanwhile, South Africa, thanks to our monetary policies, was contemplating on giving South Africans a stimulus package of R350, that is equivalent, to less than $25. Why can’t we just print money like that? Developing nations suck.

Anyways, this just highlights the difference in Central Banks, Fiscal & Monetary Policies, which leads us to understand that macroeconomics is not an isolated event, and includes international trade — another very important aspect in economics as a whole…
(I’d be such a good primary school teacher, wow — give me my teaching certificate today!)
So, this, was a brief post on economics 101, which will guide us through the next posts. Economics is about making choices, to maximize happiness whilst consuming limited resources. 

On a broader perspective, economics can be divided into macro and micro economics, and both sectors can be examined even further in posts to come, I just hope that this Econ 101 post, will make you like economics!
