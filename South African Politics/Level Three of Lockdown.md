# Level Three of Lockdown
## But Vaccines Coming Soon...

The title pretty sums up everything, let’s just hope that it is what is is, because knowing South African Governance… it might turn into something else entirely.

Anyways, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on the 11th of Janaury 2021, that’s yesterday if you’re reading this today. He started off by stating the daringly obvious by emphasizing the severity of the situation at hand & mentioned that vaccinations are on the way.

There will be three Phases of vaccinations.
Phase 1:
Health Workers

Phase 2:
Essential Workers: Teachers, Police, Municipal Workers & Other Frontline 
Personnel.

Phase 3:
The rest of the population.

He also slightly, vaguely touched upon Women’s Economic Empowerment, which was not as detailed as the speech mentioning vaccinations, #justsaying.

So, I suppose it is accurate to assume that 2021, we will be looking forward to vaccinations & women economic empowerment.
