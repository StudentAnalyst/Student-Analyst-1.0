# The ABCs of South African Politics
## A Brief Introduction

Apartheid…
BEE…
Corruption…

Politics in South Africa is often marred with controversy, and a complicated history that makes everything seem continuously tiresome, and equally exciting at the same time, literally all the time.

There is always something interesting going on. A commission about this and that here, an investigation about this one and that one there, pastors fleeing the country. Sometimes there’s tinned fish and garlic involved.

Anyways, South Africa is such a unique, unpredictable place, especially politically, because everything is just so meticulously intertwined that you have to dig deep into everything, just to find more mysterious events.

Even though South African Politics can be comical and downright entertaining, the ever widening gap between the poor and the rich means that there is also a great majority who think that there is absolutely nothing humorous about how this state is governed.

Understanding South African Politics is as easy as ABC, that is Apartheid, BEE and Corruption. Haha. Anyways, to look at present day South Africa, you can never ignore the past, the past which has propelled us into this present, alleged democratic rainbow nation.

The past, which is constantly used by the current leaders to explain almost everything! Not only do the current leaders of this democracy continuously blame the previous regime, the benefactors of the previous regime also seem to blame everything on the current regime. It’s a deplorable circle of madness, I mean Einstein would be pissed.

For example,
Random Person: “Excuse me Mr President…”
President: “Whatever your question is, the answer is Apartheid, Exile and WHITE MONOPOLY CAPITAL! They must redistribute the wealth, nationalize the mines, and bring back the land those ones.”
Random Person: “Oh, I just wanted to tell you that you dropped your wallet!”

Another example,
Random Person: “Beep!”
Other Person: “Why is this BEE driving? This is State Capture, Investigate him!”
Random Person: “The Robot is Green”

Anyways, I hope that, this brief, seemingly redundant introductory post emphasizes the uniqueness that is South Africa, and our racially charged past and present which continues to influence people’s decisions.

Anyways, which other country has got unique terms such as ‘State Capture’ and ‘White Monopoly Capital’, and uses words like ‘Robot’ to describe traffic lights?
Anyways South African Politics is exciting, unique and whatever word you have in mind is also applicable. Whatever emotional state you feel when you think of this country is absolutely valid as well, which is why it deserves it’s own category, and I cannot wait to delve deeper into it, unless I receive a cease and desist letter down the line.

I’m so excited.
