## So You’re Apolitical? Just Get Into Politics Already

It is actually impossible, to not be into politics, because politics is essentially suppose to represent the whole of society, this is why we have such leaders today…because it is not the will of the actual majority, it is the will of the majority who are voting.

Even though politicians, especially South African politicians arouse anger even amongst the most peaceful of people, it is important to vote and participate, because this might eliminate and reduce the current alleged ‘corruption’ & ‘looting’ that is present in all spheres of South African life, there is ‘corruption’ even at grassroots levels. Some of us participate in corruption without even knowing. Corruption has become structural and systematic.

Anyways, this post is about apolitical people, and why they should get into politics and make a difference. Even though the leader of the EFF, Julius Malema, wants the forthcoming Municipal Elections to be moved to 2024, I say, keep up with the News, and vote when there are any elections presents.

Stop being apolitical. South Africa is one of the most politically charged nations, it is simply impossible for you to be apolitical, therefore, try to be more active in your wards, municipalities & regions.

More on South African politics…

Apparently there’s calls for Cyril Ramaphosa to appear on the Zondo Commission after Brian Molefe’s speech. Let’s just wait and see how that goes…
