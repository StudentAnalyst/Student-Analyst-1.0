# Cyclone Eloise
## R.I.P Jackson Mthembu
Sad times in South Africa this week, as we deal with the loss of Jackson Mthembu, due to COVID-19 complications, whilst dealing with the devastating effects of Cyclone Eloise which flooded certain parts of South & Southern Africa.
Jackson Mthembu

As I quote Wikipedia, Verbatim:
> Jackson Mphikwa Mthembu (5 June 1958–21 January 2021) was a South African politician who served as Minister in the Presidency of South Africa's government, and as a parliamentarian of the African National Congress (ANC). Previously, he served as the Whip of Parliament for the ruling ANC as well as the national spokesperson for the ANC
Mthembu was born in Witbank on 5 June 1958. His mother was Nantoni Mthembu.
Mthembu served as the MEC for Transport in Mpumalanga from 1997 to 1999, during which he was criticized for spending R2.3 million on ten BMWs.
> 
> Mthembu was elected to National Assembly of South Africa in 1999, where he served till his death in 2021.
On 28 November 2017, some of Mthembu's ANC colleagues criticised him for 'colluding' with the DA to schedule a debate on state capture in Parliament in defiance of President Jacob Zuma and his colleagues in the ANC caucus who had already called for a more inclusive process to investigate state capture.
>
> Mthembu was married to Thembi Mthembu. He had six children. His daughter, 25-year-old Nokwhezi Mthembu, committed suicide on 20 March 2019 at their Pelican Park parliamentary village home in Cape Town.
In 2014, Mthembu was shot in the cheek while using an Absa ATM on Mandela Street in Witbank CBD. The armed man and his accomplices proceeded to Mthembu's car, where four of his friends were waiting for him, and robbed them of their money and cellphones.
Mthembu died due to COVID-19 complications during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa on 21 January 2021.

Well, at least Wikipedia succinctly explained the life and times of Jackson Mthembu, he will surely be missed.

## State Capture Commission
In unrelated news, the State Capture Commission didn't miss a beat, and they are still going unnecessarily strong, I suppose we shall have to wait until the end of January to see if there is anything interesting there.

## Cyclone Eloise
The Cyclone left devastation in its wake in Northern South Africa, as well as other Southern African countries including eSwatini, Mozambique, Zimbabwe & Botswana. I do sincerely hope that those who were impacted are going to recover timeously as the flood impacted agriculture & housing.
