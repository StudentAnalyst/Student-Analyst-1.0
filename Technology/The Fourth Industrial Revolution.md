# The Fourth Industrial Revolution
## A Seemingly Dystopian Future

Technology has lifted a great deal of weight and responsibility off our shoulders. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has and will help in obliterating the line between human effort and machine excellence with Automation (automatic control) and Artificial Intelligence.

But, it’s not all rainbows, unicorns and sunshine. The pandemic (oh, here we go again) has accelerated the need for automated tasks and machine enriched applications because human resources have proven to be, human with human limitations. This leaves very little room for these actual human beings to perform labour that will allow them to earn an income, which they can use to better their livelihoods, or just, simply afford bread.

The continuously widening gap between the rich and the poor is the perfect recipe that will lead us straight towards a fictional dystopian society — but, the problem is, it is no longer a fictional ideology, it is happening right before our eyes (e.g. Zandspruit, Ruimsig Informal Settlement, Alexandra etc).

The rich are shamelessly (nothing new here) hoarding wealth that is acquired through technological automated advancements, and the poor are getting poorer, and it’s not just the poor getting poorer, the middle class are getting poor, the working class are getting poor. Almost everyone is getting poor, except for maybe Jeff Bezos, Tim Cooke and their CEO buddies in the tech sphere.

People, human beings, are being laid off and informal settlements are encroaching golf estates and affluent suburbs, while some of these allegedly ‘rich’ neighborhoods have houses and apartments sitting empty, possibly because:
A. People lost their jobs and moved back home
B. Landlords are refusing to lower the rental which will allow people dignified housing
C. People lost their jobs, or earn below-the-minimum-wage and just decided to construct shelter (shacks) near the previous apartments or current jobs.

Anyways, technology inspired dystopia aside, I still believe that we will find the solution within the problem, and we will have to also use technological developments in order to fight poverty and human greed.

I really hope, that the future is some form of tech-oriented utopia and not some capitalistic hellhole, where one magnificent tech company, with the tallest shiniest building in the universe is worshipped and all the people are living in abject poverty while thinking that one day, they too shall be magnificent with a sensational style and worshipped by the masses.

Honestly, there is absolutely no need for a few billionaires to exist and a multitude of poor people to exist simultaneously.
If it weren’t for humans and their (our) sense of greed, I know that technology is a very beautiful thing and we can do so much good.
With this section or category (technology)of my blog, I will be discussing the bright and the dark side of technology.
