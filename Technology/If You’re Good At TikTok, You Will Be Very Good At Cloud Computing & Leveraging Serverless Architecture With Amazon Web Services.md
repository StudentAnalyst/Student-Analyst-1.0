# If You’re Good At TikTok, You Will Be Very Good At Cloud Computing & Leveraging Serverless Architecture With Amazon Web Services
## Click And Deploy

My headline is a self-explanatory mouthful of terms, but I believe that if you’re good at TikTok, you will be even better with deploying services on AWS. I mean, the structure is pretty familiar and similar, you just select a bunch of resources and make something amazing.

I have seen how easily some people have adapted to TikTok and have created amazing videos, and using the features in a way that nobody would have predicted, therefore, I believe if some of these TikTokers, were given the opportunity to do the same on AWS, they could absolutely leverage the applications in a way that none of us would have thought.

I mean, creativity, thinking out of the box, a youthful exuberance, eagerness to learn ( & show off) and adaptability are the ultimate skills to possess in the 21st Century, and most especially, amidst the gloom and doom of the current pandemic. (Thankfully, Vaccines are on the way).

Now, I am not saying that TikTokers, with no prior knowledge of the AWS Global Infrastructure, should just run rampant, and go ahead and launch EC2 Instances and Deploy Applications on AWS Lambda… they would obviously need to study the White Papers and gain sufficient knowledge, and do the relevant certifications — I recommend starting off with the Cloud Practitioner Certification, and if you truly enjoy it (which you probably will), you can advance and continue.

Yeah, TikTok And Amazon? This may seem like the ultimate cross-over, but since I truly believe that they would absolutely be good at it, besides, some of TikToks features, make me feel like, TikTok as a platform is leveraging AWS or some other Cloud Computing Giant (I mean, this is so obvious), but they’re so cloudy.
So, if you’re good at TikTok, why not look into Cloud Computing & Amazon Web Services? Am I promoting AWS, because I want people to get into it so that I have more Certified People and thus join higher tiers of the Amazon Partner Network?

**Yes, yes I am.**

In Unrelated News, A Shameless Plug:
If you’re interested in pursuing cloud certifications, but you don’t have the necessary funds, visit: 
youthacademy.bamboocharcoal.co.za

Also, if you’re interested in sponsoring me, or other youthful compatriots in pursuing cloud certifications, you can also visit: youthacademy.bamboocharcoal.co.za

I hope to create a database of those who have a surplus of funds and with those who have a deficit, and need to pursue technological qualifications.
If you are Amazon Certified, and Would Like To Join Bamboo Charcoal Creative Technology, so that they can become a part of the Amazon Partner Network, you can visit: www.bamboocharcoal.co.za/jobs and click on Partner, and send them a message, and see how it goes.

The Future Is Technology, And The Future Is Youth, Therefore The Future Is A Youthful Tech, Technological Youth…

Anyways, I really hope whatever field you’re in, you consider AWS at some point.
