# Trying to Create a Robot Content Creator
## Covid-19 Has Definitely Catalyzed And Accelerated The Need For Robot Content Creators
### As A Human Being I am TIRED!

Well, I think I have created enough posts in order to start working on creating a CGI Model, Robot Content Creator… my posts were not as in depth as I had hoped (because I would absolutely love to learn from my future robot), therefore, I will have to continue writing every once in a while, just to feed my future endeavor(s)…As in, create data for the future robot (muhahah).

The OCD daily structure will remain the same, except it will be weekly, for example:
Youth Development: Sunday, February 14th
Global & African Affairs: Monday, March 1st
South African Politics: Tuesday, March 9th
Economics: Wednesday, March 17th
Technology: Thursday, March 25th
Finance: Friday, April 2nd
Business: Saturday, April 10th
Ntombizakhona Sunday, April 18th

This new structure, might actually make the articles much longer and in depth (whilst also giving me time to study, because, I have been slacking. So, I suppose I will have to launch my Robot in 2022, unless Robot-Tech becomes cheaper and easier to use this year.

I do have mixed feelings about the cost of the technology as I feel as though CGI models might just replace human models - so I am really unsure as to whether they will be cheaper or more expensive, because have you seen how people love Anime characters? I think CGI models will be a hit, especially if they are super realistic and can be remodeled to represent whatever impossible beauty standards that are present.

But, I also think, that someone might actually just create a "filter like" way to convert ourselves into seemingly CGI model like creatures, and we can adjust them to make them look a particular way - and we develop even worse beauty and body standards, as we try to emulate CGI versions of ourselves, the same way, we have tried to replicate Snapchat filter versions of ourselves. Anyways, that is a story for another day.

And, why do I think Robot Content Creators will also be a mega hit? Well, have you seen the way people will literally attempt to comment on anything and everything even if the person explicitly asked them not to? Well, imagine, a Robot Content Creator, who exists to be communicated with, and does not get frustrated by the endless back and forth, Tennis match type of communication that just keeps on going, until there is a winner. Just hit the arguments back and forth, won't you?

Well, to be quite honest nothing has been as thrilling as I had anticipated thanks to the never-ending story of COVID-19, and COVID-19 related misfortunes, but, at least, vaccinations are on the way, and it does not look promising, I would sure as hell like to watch and see how the South African Government manages to successfully distribute it… but, at least they are working with the private sector, so I expect minimal chaos.

Did you see the American version of the Vaccine Distribution where they used the start-up of some kid (You can research Philly Fighting COVID) and it went wrong, well I sure hope that doesn't happen to South Africa. But there is already a bunch of new COVID related companies… Just imagine if the South African Government was more efficient, just imagine. We can all foresee the chaos, but, we are hoping for the best.

So much happened over the past month alone, that may have made reality seem a little more surreal than usual… but, I do certainly wish that you are continuously trying your best.

Covid-19 has definitely catalyzed and accelerated the need for robot content creators and CGI models, to entertain us, because, as a fellow human being, I am, dutifully… exhausted!
