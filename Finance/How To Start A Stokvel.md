*'Stokvels'* are a very common money saving practice in South Africa, here are the benefits of joining a Stokvel, how to start a Stokvel, and most importantly, be wary of scams.

## Benefits of Joining A Stokvel
### 1. Make Better Financial Decisions
Stokvels will help you develop the ability to make better financial decisions, in regards to spending. Knowing that you will be required to contribute a certain amount monthly, and knowing that you will receive a certain amount at a certain date, will make you make better financial decisions overall.

### 2. Enhance Your Knowledge on the Subject At Hand
Stokvels are varied, not all of them are a basic money saving rotation scheme. Some are property related, others are investment based. This variety, will enable members to discuss the latest news in each sector. And the more knowledge you acquire about something, from people you trust, limits your chances of being scammed elsewhere.

### 3. A Sense Of Community
**'No man is an island.'** A stokvel can give you a sense of society. Stokvels can become more than just about money, you can have people to talk to about all sorts of things.

## How To Start A Stokvel
Now that we've looked at some of the benefits of starting a stokvel, we look at the how…

### 1. Start Off With Family, Friends & Limited Members
If you want to start a Stokvel, it is a good idea to start off with family, friends, and people you can trust. Never have more than 12 members in the group, because this might cause chaos and lead to a default factory setting in human beings: **Greed.**

### 2. Start Off With Small Amounts
You don't want to start off with exorbitant amounts. Start off small, so that you can see how it goes, and how it can be improved. And if the Stokvel fails at the initial or starting stages, you won't feel as though you have lost too much money.

### 3. Have A Common Goal
Having a common goal as to why the Stokvel was set up and what it aims to achieve, will make everyone's life easier in the Stokvel. For example, is it a family Stokvel towards building a bigger house? Or is it a family rotational Stokvel where one member gets something monthly? What is the point of the Stokvel. Set a goal, and don't deviate from it.

### 4. Have Clear Instructions And Agreements
The instructions and agreements need to be clear and unambiguous, about how money will be collected or distributed to ensure that there is no chaos, and so that, in the event that disagreements do occur, they can be resolved quickly and lead to an update in agreements and instructions to prevent future disputes.

### 5. Collateral Is Important When Money Is Involved
Where there's money lending, money borrowing and money moving around - you need to have measures in place to mitigate default. Therefore, before adding group members, you need to vet each other, and ensure that everyone has appropriate collateral if they are unable to meet the requirements of the Stokvel at a later stage.

### 6. Communicate Consistently & Effectively
Communication is key. You need to communicate consistently in order to have a successful Stokvel, and meet your goals successfully.
