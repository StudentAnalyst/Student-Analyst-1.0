# Work On Your Idea 
## Support Small Businesses

Today just seems like a good day to work on your ideas, develop them, and see how you can make them profitable & executable.

If you have not yet been possessed by the entrepreneurial spirit, then just support someone's venture near you.

Since COVID-19 relief & stimulus packages are a myth at this point, we all just need to support each other.

If you have spare funds, you can also make a donation to your favorite small business, just to encourage them to continue or just give to give.
