## Unpredictability

The simple definition for the word business, according to the online Oxford dictionary when you type “business meaning” is:

> a person’s regular occupation, profession, or trade -Definitions from Oxford Languages (Accessed: 22 September 2020, 16:23)

With that definition, I guess it might be pretty accurate to presume that we are all into business. We are all businessmen, businesswomen, businessfolk, business oriented human beings, amazing! It makes me think of the legendary quote by Shawn Corey Carter

> I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man! – Shawn Corey Carter

That quote right there, is just, purely timeless if I must so say myself.

But, in all honesty, business, or the participation in commercial activity for personal financial gain, has been around for centuries and will probably continue for the next decade or so because of the capitalistic nature of human beings.

With this part of my blog, the business category, I hope to analyse and study more about business.

Anyways, with that said, the abominable year that is 2020, leading into 2021, looks like a great year to venture into the unknown and experiment with all forms of trade, professions and even occupations.

Business, essentially.

2021 looks like the year where you can just try and try anything and everything over and over and over again.

Fail remarkably, you’re winning actually.

I mean, this pandemic has killed numerous careers.

Some of us, technically don’t have a choice but to attempt new careers and business ventures. And you know what, 2020 (what remains of it) is the year for that.

Furthermore, if 2020 has taught us anything, is that the future is just simply not as predictable as we thought.

The only thing predictable about prediction is unpredictability.

So, if you can: Start a business (you’re a business yourself).

Learn a new trade.

Just, venture into a new career.

Who knows what the future has for us?

We don’t, so just try something new.
