### A Journey of Continuous Learning

*Originally published: November 22, 2020*  
*Author: Ntombizakhona Mabaso*

I am an apt student (because I will probably never stop studying or learning).

I like observing the world around me while voicelessly (seemingly) participating in it too, but I shall be voiceless no more, and I will start speculating, philosophizing and theorizing on the internet, hence the name 'Student Analyst' fits this blog very well because it emphasizes the infinite process that is studying or learning, and the growth that occurs from analyzing everything that happens around us and responding accordingly.

I, like every breathing human being, need to live while I'm alive.

As Rob Bell once said,

> "Holism is when two plus two equals infinity."

Therefore, I need to deal with the consequences of the actions of the human race as a whole, whilst simultaneously dealing with my own misfortunes, failures and achievements, as I navigate the economical, political and technological sphere of which I exist in.

The pandemic has undoubtedly, somewhat forcibly, redrawn me (and you too) back into the immersive world of virtual reality, whilst opening my eyes to the grim, harsh reality in which we have all been hurled in.

Even though the global pandemic has and continues to disrupt our lives, I have made the unilateral decision to look at the dimly lit, allegedly bright side of life through this blog…

## 🎯 Mission

I hope to encourage myself (and maybe others, more specifically the youth, and people with no prior interest to the subjects I hope to discuss) to read more about:

- 📚 Self-development
- 💼 Business
- 🏛️ Politics
- 📊 Economics
- 💰 Finance
- 📰 Current affairs
- 💻 Technology

Because quite a great deal has been happening and will continue to happen in the world, and we need to be equipped with knowledge and solutions, no matter how minor.
