# The US Capitol Attack
## Are Economic Systems Biased Against Certain Nations?


I had initially planned on doing an ‘Economics 101’ type of post, but I suppose that will be a topic for another day, because recent global events have revealed to us, that no man, something is inherently wrong with the world, and it just definitely does not work the way it is allegedly suppose to work according to textbooks…

We just continue to see the remnants and effects of the unfair historical systems, that subjugated certain nations & people.

Honestly, if the US Capitol Attack (some people are describing it as a ‘Terrorist Attack’ & others an ‘Attempted Coup’), had happened in Africa or The Middle East, the domestic currencies of these nations would have lost value, and they probably would have been sanctioned, and it would have taken them at least two more decades to recover their economies.

How come the US Dollar is not losing value after the antics of Donald Trump & his supporters? Honestly, I expected to wake up to the rand being worth more, at least. But, nope! I guess being a Military Superpower (cough, cough: Bullies) must be really nice.

I suppose, in the following weeks, we will have to delve deeper into the history of economics, currencies & exchange rates to find more answers.
And we can actually make contrasts on what Economics is supposed to be and what is actually is, because, the world is refusing to work the way it is suppose to be working lately…

Perhaps all the illusions have been shattered, and we are finally seeing the world exactly for what it is, and no form of euphemism will make us see it otherwise.
