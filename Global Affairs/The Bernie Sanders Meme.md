# The Bernie Sanders Meme
## Something Lighthearted For A Change


Honestly, the Bernie Sanders meme provided such light heartedness and humor during such tumultuous times where we are faced with uncertainty and gruesome news, left, right & center.

Well, the United States of America, has a new President: President Joe Biden, and you know, besides the fact that he is old, I have not formulated quiet an opinion of him as yet, and I have not researched him at all (see why I need to accelerate the conversion of this blog into a robot: it would have researched everything on its own). I hope he is the opposite of Donald Trump entirely…


Speaking of Donald Trump, he is currently being impeached, which means that he may never run for President again but, I do believe that him, and his supporters are definitely going to make everything ungovernable (given how close the numbers were during the election). Donald Trump doesn’t seem like the guy who would go down without a fight, in simple terms, he does seem like quite a sore loser.

But, on a more positive note (for the rest of the world, not so positive for America). The lethal combination of Donald Trump and Covid-19, unmasked the fact that the United States of America is just like any good old third world nation masquerading as a superpower just because they spend more money on their military then they do on their citizens.

Do you remember this classic statement by Donald Trump when he referred to certain nations as shitholes, well, we now know, that he was just projecting, and the United States is the ultimate shithole. I need to go scrub my mouth, mind and hands with bleach, because I do hate vulgar terms…
In terms of African Affairs, well, I just hope that the nations that were impacted by the cyclone are okay.
