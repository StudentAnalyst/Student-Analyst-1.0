# The Police Brutality Pandemic
## Multicultural & Multiracial Societies

Police Brutality is quite a simple, self-explanatory term, to say the least and needs no further explanation, or does it?
It is indeed a very broad term that encompasses various forms of abuse and maltreatment from police officials. (Who represent the State, whether they choose to acknowledge it or not).

Anyways, police brutality refers to more than just excessive force when handling a situation. It includes false accusations, verbal abuse, racial abuse, torture… in essence, it is considered a Human Rights violation, and is actually illegal in many countries — kind off.

Most forms of Police Brutality are essentially structural, systematic and represent State Violence. And what is the Structure, System & Stat
e of some these nations? They are inherently, historically, presently, currently and VIOLENTLY anti-Black in particular.
In this post I will mainly discuss the United States Of America, Nigeria & South Africa.

### Police Brutality in The United States of America
## The Black Lives Matter Movement
At this point the Black Lives Matter Movement & Protests have been covered sufficiently across most media outlets, much to the demise of the movement, because, there are alternative voices that treat it as some form of Terrorist Group, when they are just fighting for equality & humanity.

In the United States, it is quite obvious how the systemic, structural violence against Black People evolved. It evolved from slavery, and continued to be an epidemic that people are fighting against to this day. United States Black Americans literally, cannot breathe because of the injustices.

Imagine fighting to be treated like a decent human being for hundreds of years, just to be continuously gaslighted, and thus having to fight even more each day. Surely, that is absolutely unfair…

And, an unanticipated event that occurred to highlight the fact that Police Brutality in The United States is inherently & systemically anti-black? The US Capitol Invasion. I do not need to say anything further.

### Police Brutality in South Africa
## The Fees Must Fall Movement
South Africa is a unique country, because it was the last country in Africa to gain independence or ‘freedom’ from settler rule, that happened, less than 30 years ago — in 1994.

South Africa is unique because the systematic segregation between Black & White People, and the violence that was inflicted by the state against The Black People of South Africa was Constitutional!

So, we know where our Police Brutality evolved from, it evolved from Apartheid, and we see the remnants of this system all around us. It continues to be extremely unfair, and anti-black…in Africa.

The Fees Must Fall Movement, was just an innocent, peaceful protest that prioritized free & affordable education. But, alas, we observed and were traumatized for life (at least I was) as we observed young, Black, unarmed students get shot at by police.

The racism, was evident, because white students started forming barriers in front of the black students, and surprise, surprise, the police did not open fire.

Similar scenarios occurred in the United States of America, where white ‘allies’ would use themselves as a ‘fence’ against the police and their Black compatriots, and police didn’t fire… These scenarios emphasize the fact that these systems are anti-black, anti-black youth in particular.

### Police Brutality in Nigeria
## The EndSars Movement
Therefore, the current Global & African Affairs are just the proof we need to recognize that the World Is Anti-Black & Police Brutality is a pandemic that is in desperate need of a vaccine.
